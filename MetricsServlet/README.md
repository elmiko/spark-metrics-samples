# MetricsServlet

All of the metrics samples in this directory were created with the default
MetricsServlet.

No changes to the `metrics.properties` configuration was required.

This [tutorial-sparkpi-python-flask](https://github.com/radanalyticsio/tutorial-sparkpi-python-flask)
application was used as the driver.
