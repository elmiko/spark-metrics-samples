# CsvSink

This folder contains 3 subdirectories `driver`, `master` and `worker`. Each
of these contains the CSV files generated by the CsvSink over a short run time.

The `metrics.properties` file was modified to add the following:

```
*.sink.csv.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.CsvSink
*.sink.csv.period=10
*.sink.csv.unit=seconds
*.sink.csv.directory=/tmp/

master.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
worker.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
driver.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
executor.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
```

This [tutorial-sparkpi-python-flask](https://github.com/radanalyticsio/tutorial-sparkpi-python-flask)
application was used as the driver.
